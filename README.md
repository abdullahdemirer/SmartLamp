# SmartLamp
*First of all, my project is the lamp that can be controlled remotely.The project consists of two stages, hardware and software. Its hardware materials are arduino board, arduino bluetooth module, a led lamp and a resistor with connection cables. The software part consists of 2 stages. The first is to establish a connection between the arduino and the bluetooth module, and transmit the information from the user through the bluetooth module to the arduino. For the second stage, the user transmits the commands to control the lamp to the arduino.* </br>

**I chose pin number 8 to send value to the LED lamp. In my project, I designed it in such a way that if the user sends the value 1 to the bluetooth module via the interface, the led will turn on and if it sends 0, it will turn off**
